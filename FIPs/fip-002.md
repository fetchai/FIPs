## Abstract

Raise max_gas setting to 3M FET from 2M FET and increase the max bytes per block from 200KB to 300KB

## Motivation

Currently the max_gas and max bytes per block on the mainnet are not in alignmnent with those on the testnet. 

## Specification

The max_gas setting is being raised to 3M FET from 2M FET and we are also increasing the max bytes per block in order to allow bigger and more complex smart contracts to be deployed on the network. These on-chain parameter changes are also being implemented to align with the actual testnet configuration. 

## Rationale

Fetch-ai Network supports Cosmwasm based smart contracts that can support complex business logic. Such complex smart contracts require a higher gas limit for deploying them and a higher byte limit for storing them. Fetch-ai Network ecosystem has new DApps that are using complex smart contracts and will need these higher limits to launch. The values proposed in this FIP for the max_gas and max bytes have proven to be appropriate for the complex smart contracts on the testnet where such DApps have been successfully testing. Therefore, these parameter changes now need to be applied on the Mainnet.
