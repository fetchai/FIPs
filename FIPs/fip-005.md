## Abstract

Increase the maximum validator set from 60 to 70.

## Motivation
Increasing the number of validators on Fetch-ai network would cause more decentralization

## Specification

Set the value of the ‘Max validators’ parameter to ‘MaxValidators:60’

## Rationale
Increasing the number of validators to 70 would increase the probability of detecting any malicious behavior on the chain 
Higher decentralization and more options for delegators to delegate their stake
