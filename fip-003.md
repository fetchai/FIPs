## Abstract

Increase the base minimum commission validators can offer to 5%.

## Motivation

To aid in the decentralization of the Fetch-ai network and to improve the longevity of validator services.

## Specification

Set the value of the `MinCommissionRate` parameter for validators to 0.050000000000000000 (5% commission).

## Rationale

Currently, there are validators on the Fetch-ai Network that operate at low-to-zero percent commission. This has contributed to the network’s centralization.

Currently, only 26% of the total 60 active validators are running low-to-zero percent commission, yet this small set has 40% of all FET staked to them and they make up half of the top 10 validators. This skew in the data is worrisome and shows that delegators are likely not looking into important factors, such as a validator's contributions to the chain, involvement in discussion, uptime, whether they’ve been slashed before, etc, and are merely maximizing APY by staking without a cut, or just a minimal cut, being taken.

Furthermore, there are costs associated with running a validator node on the network (e.g. infrastructure and electricity) and one of the ways validators offset these costs is via the commission rate. If validators are running at low-to-zero percent commission then it is likely they are running their node at a loss. This effectively puts smaller entities who cannot absorb this loss out of the validation competition which does not bode well for the longevity of the network’s security. If all validators were guaranteed a minimum commission, it would ensure that all validators have a way of offsetting costs without creating a toxic environment of having to lower commission in order to compete.

Therefore, the community benefits from the better secured longevity of all validators in the set, and the validators benefit from a more fair and even playing field that allows them to attract delegations through their contributions to the chain. Hopefully, this also leads to delegators becoming more involved in the process of choosing a validator instead of solely relying on the commission rate alone.
