## Abstract

A short (~200 word) description of the problem being addressed and the solution being proposed.
 
## Motivation

Critical for FIPs that want to change the Fetch.ai protocol. The motivation should clearly explain why the existing systems, processes, or protocols are inadequate to address the problem that this FIP solves. FIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.

## Specification

The main in-depth specification of the solution being proposed. The specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature being proposed.
 
## Rationale

Describe what motivated the design, why particular design decisions were made. Present alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other systems. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.
